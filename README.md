We have chosen to focus on the installation and deployment aspect of computing services for our cloud project. We'll be using MySQL because it has a backend SQL server. Our main goal is to deploy, and link, corresponding VM's inside the CloudLab's Openstack infrastructure to create a unified computing service to users.

Documentation:

MySQL is an open source database based on SQL. MySQL runs on the Oracle cloud and is used by many businesses and organizations. It is commonly used for web applications and runs on UNIX, Windows, and Mac OS. For our project we’re going to deploy VM’s for the service nodes provided by MySQL. The VM’s will be moved to the Cloud and be linked together once the proper network is established.
